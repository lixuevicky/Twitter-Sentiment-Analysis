# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
(Sentiment analysis of 1.6 million labelled tweets)

• Explored 1.6 million labelled tweets with topic modeling and wordcloud; applied VADER sentiment analysis as benchmark;

• Transformed text with TFIDF vetorizer and then classified with machine learning methods: logistic regression, naive bayes and support vector machine;

• Trained deep learning architectures including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) using self-trained word2vec embedding layers to achieve higher accuracy.
